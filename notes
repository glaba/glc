Notes:

Process to follow when adding a new expression to the parser:
	Create the rule
	Create the corresponding AST type, inheriting from node_impl using CRTP
	Add a static function make() to the AST type that creates an unique_ptr to the type
	Create a selector for the rule and add the selector to the list of selectors
		If the rule has children, set their parent to point to the current AST node
	Create a visitor for the AST node if it has children

Fields of units that can be used freely and related notes:
	startHp
	startMana
	supplyProvided
	size
	buildTime (divide modifier by 20)
	cost
	healthbarOffset
	healthbarWidth
	selectionOffsetY
	tabPriority
	potentially the volumes
	dustCreationChance (multiply modifier by 20)
	visionHeightBonus
	oscillationAmplitude
	height
	cargoUse
	projectileStartHeight
	lifetime (divide modifier by 20)
	limit

	All checks for scaled quantities should not be equalities but tight inequalities
